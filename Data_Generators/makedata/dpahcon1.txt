1       Enter the ^light^, for we are the ^Children^ of the ^Sun^.  Light reveals much, and the light of the sun reveals all.
2       Walk swiftly through the darkness, and return soon to the light.
5       Did they send you? They know nothing of use. They dwell in shadow. When you are ready to search for knowledge, speak with us.
6       We are the ^Children^ of the ^Sun^, and the gatherers of knowledge. We walk the path in light.
7       ^It^ is the eldest and wisest of the races. It is the guardian of ^God's Eye^.
8       The guild do not seek knowledge or understanding of the universe... Only profit in _it. Be wary in your dealings with them and in the deals that you accept from them.
9       They are not worth speaking of. They warp and pervert the light. They are much too offensive and vile. Perhaps they are... a dark race.
10      They are immovable. They forge their ships in iron and bind them with light.
11      Ah... the ^Tetrad^. We know of them.
12      One of the two bipartisan Quai Pa'loi factions. They are convinced that Quai squander their light by trading with other races.
12      The Pai struggle to gain support. They struggle but they have no light. They struggle and cannot defeat the ^Q'ooul^.
13      We do not care to involve ourselves in their quarrels and have maintained neutrality throughout the dispute. 
14      The Icon are rarely seen and never heard.  They are content to stay on their homeworld. We know none who maintain a dialogue with them.
15      The Titerian are also seekers of knowledge, but they do not look for _it in the sun. They find _it where the light has not traveled. They see before and beyond the light.
16      We have not sensed their light. We know not of who you speak.
20      Many ages ago they arrived after an odd stellar occurrence.  They feigned weakness. They feigned the search for light. In the course of things they built horrible ^devices^.
20      They came to us in nightmares and used their devices to control the others. They spread like a disease.
20      We gathered the others into the light. We gathered together the sentients and formed the Kendar. The ^Kendar^ discovered a ^secret^, and they cornered and defeated the Dark Kind.
20      We cauterized the dark wound with the fire of the sun. We are D'pahk.
22      A pirate. He attacks at random and always takes.  He attacks all equally, save for the Titerians. They know him before he is.
23      We have seen them... There are many, but they are not illuminated properly for us to know their function.
24      We have heard of them and where to find them... But papesia is a myth. The Hallifax wander in darkness.
25      Our world, Talparra, is deep and warm.  The canyons near the sun are ^breathtaking^ and ^inspiring^ to all those who seek light.  Near us is a ^planet^ which glows with light.  We wish to examine its light, but we are ^blinded^.
26      Ah, knowledge also springs from the exchange of goods.  Show us what you have, that we might learn.
27      _It is some type of a ritual... So old that we are not sure its performers even remember its original intent.
29      The shunt drive is a theoretical system, but we have never heard of a working version of _it.
31      You know of god's eye?! We have heard very little of _it. _It is the source of the light. All truths spring from the eye. _It is unlikely that you will ever see _it. The sengzhac have a strange religious attachment to _it.
31      Any ship that tries to approach the eye is destroyed.
31      We would pay the light of a thousand suns to see through God's Eye.
36      All comes from the ^sun^... from deep within _it.  All are its children, and we seek ^knowledge^ in the ^light^.
37      The light guides us and leads us to ^knowledge^.  Since the sun is the source of the light, then _it is also the source of knowledge.
38      Yes, we seek the knowledge of the sun.  We strive to enter into _it and find the inner ^source^.
39      _It is the ^seed^ from which all light and knowledge grows.  Knowledge stems from the source, and _it flourishes in the ^heat^ and the light.
40      The sun gives us warmth and light.  From the ^source^ deep within, we gain ^knowledge^.  One day, we will enter the sun and gain knowledge directly from the ^source^.
41      The seed is of ^iron^, but there is much more to _it than can be plainly seen.
42      We wish to know the significance.  Maybe we will learn this when we reach the source.
43      The sun is very hot.  The heat keeps us from entering into the sun.  We train and discipline ourselves to withstand the heat.  So far none of us have been strong enough to enter.
44      We refer to the sengzhac as "it" because the sengzhac are a collective entity, one brain with many bodies.  
45      Temporal anchors are the strongest shields ever built.  They were invented, along with many other interesting ^devices^, by the Dark Kind.
46      The Dark Kind had many devices... Most of them more advanced than any devices the others had.  The purpose was to make the Dark Kind strong and the others weak.
46      We hid them from the light. That is why you will not find any of their devices now.
47      _It was a temporary alliance of all the established races in the area.  The races knew that they were no match for the darkness. Only by virtue of the sun did we defeat their devices.
48      If we told you _it wouldn't be much of a secret.
49      Oh, I can feel the heat and the light in my gills even now.     
50      Yes.  Whenever I see the valleys of the sun, I am flooded with the desire to continue deeper and deeper... To enter into _it... To join with _it... But of course, then I come to my senses and go dehydrate my sorrows in a vessel of oxidants.
51      We cannot disclose its location. Some things must remain in shadow.
52      There is a shield around the ^planet^ that keeps us from approaching _it.
74      Do not speak to us of the abomination. They plague us, what with their black ships and shadow death.
79      _It is a very powerful weapon... _It breathes fiery death...Even in the depths of space.
79      We need _it to defend against the scavengers.
81      The Quai follow the Four. The Four of what we know not. In all matters the Quai divide themselves into four. "The table is built with four legs," they say. "To add is to encumber and to remove is to stumble, in all there is four."
81      We deal with the quai but do not pretend to see the Four. They dwell in shadow.
